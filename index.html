                I received my BSc in computer science at the <a
                    href="https://www.bfh.ch/en/studies/bachelor/computer-science/">Bern University of Applied
                    Sciences</a> in 2013 and my <a
                    href="https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/studies/master_s_in_bioinformatics_and_computational_biology/index_eng.html">MSc
                    in
                    Bioinformatics and Computational
                    Biology</a> at the University of Bern in 2016. In 2020 I received his doctorate in Chemistry and
                Molecular Sciences
                for his thesis “Scalable Methods for the Exploration and Visualization of Large Chemical Spaces” from
                the University of Bern under the supervision of <a href="https://gdb.unibe.ch/">Prof. Jean-Louis
                    Reymond</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main research interest is efficient machine learning and data visualisation applied to natural
                sciences, focusing on the intersection of chemistry and biology.

                After a two-year stay as a permanent research staff member at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Research#Switzerland">IBM
                    Research</a> in the Team of Teodoro Laino working
                on machine learning for biocatalysis, I started as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Pierre
                Vandergheynst at EPFL.
